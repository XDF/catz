#summary A word or two about technology selections

= Technologies =

Here are some technologies that I'm using in my project. I've also listed some technologies that I've evaluated or tested for this project but then decided not to use them. These are (marked this way).

  * Language: Perl 5 (PHP, Python, Ruby)
  * Framework: Mojolicious (Mason, Dancer, Catalyst) 
  * Database: SQLite (PostgreSQL, Redis, BerkeleyDB)
  * Caching: Memcached (Redis)

= Implementation =

   * URLs shouldn't use GET parameters
   * URL to a photo should also be a permanent URL
   * all text strings are separated from logic and layout
   * user-configurable features stored in cookie (by default Mojolicious session implementation) 
   * database access via DBI and a Memcached caching layer above it
   * database result sets as arrayrefs and positional access (hashrefs needs hash construction on DBI and according to my test impose a significant overhead)
