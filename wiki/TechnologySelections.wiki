Here are some technologies that I'm using in my project. I'm following the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. 

  * Language: Perl
  * Web Framework: Mojolicious
  * Database: SQLite
  * Caching: Memcached

= Implementation =

   * Model-View-Controller paradigm
   * Using both procedural and object-oriented programming
   * stateless application where the URL contains all the information (no cookies, no sessions)  
   * all text strings are separated from the logic and the layout
   * database access via DBI
   * four levels of caching: Last-Modified header to utilize client caching, server-side page caching, server-side model caching, server-side database result set caching (server-side caching uses Memcached)
   * database rows accessed positionally (since access by name needs hash construction on DBI and according to my test impose a significant overhead with large result sets)
   * comprehensive automated tests using Mojo::Test
