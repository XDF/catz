#summary The description of page metadata and the social media integation features

= Forced page metadata =

The base template base/heavy.html.ep forces the following metadata on all pages.

  * meta http-equiv content-type
  * meta http-equiv content-language (content langauge also set on html and body so we really are on the safe side)
  * link shortcut icon (standard old-school favicon.ico at site's root)
  * meta generator
  * meta author
  * meta copyright
  * link copyright
  * meta robots (controlled by stash variables meta_index & meta_follow, by default both are on, controllers are allowed to change)
  * meta og:site_name
  * meta fb:admins
  * link me (links to facebook fan page)
  * meta credits (gives credits to some fundamental technologies that the service is based on) 
       
= Overloadable page metadata blocks = 

The base template base/heavy.html.ep provides the following blocks that
can be overloaded by page templates if needed.

== canon ==

  * link canonical, links to the same page in the same language with default setup
  * meta og:url, just as the previous line describes

== image ==

  * meta image, links to the site's logo in png format
  * meta og:image, just as the previous line describes
