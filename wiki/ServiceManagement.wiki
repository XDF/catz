#summary Short process descriptions, notes and checklists for catza.net service management and service deployment

Please note that this page is provided as public for both due to common interest and to give me an online access to the service management notes 24/7 around the globe. The langauge used here is not polished and the notes are not complete. The tasks and commands run as root and other users are all presented as a list without information what user to use.

= Update data =

  * changes in source data format are NOT allowed
  * detect what is the production environment's path
{{{
ps -ef | grep catz
}}}
  * ship the source data files to the production enviroment's data directory
  * run database loader on meta and post (if static content has changed then include folders)
{{{
perl load.pl meta post
}}}    
  * if the load is successfull then roll to the latest version (production switches to it immediately)
{{{
perl roll.pl
}}} 
  * check that the production effectively runs on the new data (from HTML meta enviroment tag)
  * browse a few pages to make sure the production works properly
  * run incremental backup or a full backup (full is run when a gallery is completed)
{{{
backup_incr.sh
}}}       
{{{
backup_full.sh
}}}

= Revert the deployment of the data = 

  * check that the database key file to revert to exists
  * delete any newer key files (production switches immediately)
  * run incremental backup
{{{
backup_incr.sh
}}}       

= Deploy a new static content with a new version of the data =

  * ship the static content
  * progress using the instructions for data update           
      
= Deploy a new version of the service =

== on dev ==

  * make sure that you have made at least one database loading compared to the version in production (data version must have been changed forward), if not then make a pseudo loading (loading just meta is simplest if no changes)
  * roll to the latest database version 
  * clean old database versions from /db (leave only the latest and the latest key file)
  * clean logs from /log
  * check what is in /temp and clean it if needed     
  * fresh start memcached
  * run tests
    * all test should pass without warnings
    * check that the stats are resonable (Files=13, Tests=20894, 279 wallclock secs)
  * SVN commit the project if not yet committed  

== on prod ==

  * detect what is the production environment's path
{{{
ps -ef | grep catz
}}}
  * delete all stuff from the non-production environment directory 
{{{ 
...
rm -fR *
}}}
  * deploy the new version of the application by shipping all files
    * on slow connection consider gzipping the database before shipping and then ungzipping
  * set the database file to read only  
  * run tests
    * all should pass without warnings
    * check that the stats are resonable (Files=13, Tests=20894, 195 wallclock secs)     
  * fire up the service
{{{
hypnotoad run.pl
}}} 
  * test the service via ssh tunneled port that it appears to work as expected
  * edit nginx config to so that the proxying points to the deployed service
  * test nginx config 
{{{
nginx -t
}}}
  * reload nginx config
{{{
kill -HUP $( cat /var/run/nginx.pid )
}}}   
  * test via the public interface that the service works normally and that it runs on the correct enviroment (from HTML meta)
  * shutdown the non-production
{{{
cat hypnotoad.pid | xargs kill -TERM
}}}        
  * change the enviroment in the boot time startup script 
{{{
pico /etc/rc.local
}}}
  * run the incremental backup
{{{
backup_incr.sh
}}}       

= Update Mojolicious & Hypnotoad on the fly =

  * do the Mojolicious update on dev first to find out any issues
  * update Mojolicious via CPAN
  * run tests, although this has a limited meaning since
     * if something works incorrectly, the result goes to cache and is server from there thereafter
     * if Hypnotoad on production restarts workers, it assumably uses the new version
  * restart Hypnotoad
{{{    
kill -USR2 <pid>
}}}
  * log/production.log should indicate an new start 
{{{
[Sun Jul 17 18:39:38 2011] [info] Server listening (...)
}}}
  * hypnotoad.pid should show a fresh pid
  * check that the service appears to work
  * run the incremental backup
{{{
backup_incr.sh
}}}       

= Update Perl =

  * install the latest stable Perl, this will run for a while
{{{  
perlbrew install perl-x.yy.z
}}}
  * use the new perl only in the current session
{{{
perlbrew use perl-x.yy.z
}}}
  * install the latest CPAN
  * reload cpan
  * install the required Perl modules
  * run tests, all should pass without warnings, check that the stats are resonable: Files=13, Tests=20894, 195 wallclock secs         
  * switch to the new perl
{{{
perlbrew switch perl-x.yy.z
}}}
  * restart hypnotoad
{{{
kill -USR2 <pid>
}}}
  * run the incremental backup
{{{
backup_incr.sh
}}}
