#summary My brief opinionated comparison on Catalyst, Dancer and Mojolicious

= Catalyst =
  * Very flexible in every way: Moose can be used to extend controllers, sessions can be handled every way you like, choose almost any templating system and there already a CPAN module to do that
  * Very mature
  * Inintial startup work takes some time
  * Heavyweight with lots of dependencies
  * Tons of plugins
  * Gigantic user community
  * Routing rules are divided to controllers which I don't like
  * Feature-list is long: what I really like is a natural automatic loading of Models and to access them without a hassle
  * Very hard to get the idea behind Chained actions: there are various simple examples but I still don't get it how to use them in my cases
  * The most documented Perl MVC framework
  * Restart is a real restart: slower than with Mojolicious reload but appears to work in every case

= Dancer =
  * Sits nicely between the component-based Catalyst and web-in-a-box Mojolicious also on weight
  * Very easy to start work with
  * DSL features are a two-sided sword, depends on what you like, I prefer pure Perl against DSL
  * Has stabilized to the level that can be used in production
  * Lots of followers

= Mojolicious =
  * Very easy to start work with due to web-in-a-box design
  * Excellent dispatcher: route definitions are in one place, they are compact and the syntax is very expressive
  * Lightweight
  * Has stabilized to the level that can be used in production
  * Lots of followers
  * Development is driven by one main developer - this is both pro and con
  * Simplicity has been taken to extremes: almost everything is accessed thru $self, Catalyst separation between $self and $c might be clearer
  * Some issues rise due to the fact that when you are running router or before/after hook, you are not running a controller and so $self doesn't provide all the services available for controllers
  * Enough documentation at least for a user on my level 
  * Reload is very fast but is not as bullet-proof as Catalyst restart
