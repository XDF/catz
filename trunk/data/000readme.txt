This folder contains the source files (structured tagged text) that are the primary data source of http://catza.net/. The data from the files gets offline loaded to the database by loader and is served from database at runtime. The news articles file metanews.txt is deliberately excluded.

Notice that the files here change less often than they are updated in our data process. The files here are updated only when a new version of Catz web application engine is committed.
